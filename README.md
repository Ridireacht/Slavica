# Slavica
Rework of the [old project I've made once](https://github.com/SovietModernism/slavic-comparator). This time I decided to go for C# and make it complete.

The idea behind it is as simple as possible â€” you enter a word in English, and app shows you a bunch of translations for all Slavic languages. The whole translation process relies on the online Glosbe vocabulary and its API. The app itself here is just an aggregator and intermediary.
